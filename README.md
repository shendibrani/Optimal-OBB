About
This project aims to provide an implementation of OBB or simply known as a Box Collider in Unity with the PCA algorithm. This is in order to experiment with further optimizations in order to best repesent multiple unity gameobjects in space with one minimum viable bounding box. 
See the comparison with the Green (Unity) vs Blue (our) to see the shortcomings of using a box collider in this situation. While a better effect could theoretically be achieved with the unity collider, having an implementation which you can control is usually better.


It can be seen in action here:
